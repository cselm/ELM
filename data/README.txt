The demo of the algorithm EA-SRC is given in 'Demo_Classification_EASRC';

In addition to the main algorithm, the main contributions which utilizes the regularized ELM with a computational efficiency LOO method (RELM-LOO) is also given, with demos in 'Demo_Classification' and 'Demo_Regression';

The regressor includes the regularized ELM with a computational efficiency LOO method (RELM-LOO) is given in the folder '/utilities' named as 'regressor';

The folder '/l1ls' includes four representative sparse reconstruction algorithms;

Two classification applications and one regression application are included for illustration.
